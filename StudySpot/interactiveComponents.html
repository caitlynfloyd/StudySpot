Just wait till we tell Will that Jennifer Hayes was crying at his funeral. You’re right. You are a freak…. Who would you rather be friends with: Bowie or Kenny Rogers?

                            Nancy, seriously, you're gonna be so cool now, it's ridiculous. Do you know anything about sensory deprivation tanks? Specifically how to build one? Friends don't lie. Nobody normal ever accomplished anything meaningful in this world. Hey kiddo, would you like a balloon?

                            You shouldn't like things because people tell you you're supposed to. Um, I'm happy you're home. Hey kiddo, would you like a balloon? This is not yours to fix alone. You act like you’re all alone out there in the world, but you’re not. You’re not alone.

                            YOU BETTER RUN! She's our friend, and she's crazy! It’s about the shadow monster, isn’t it? It's just, sometimes... people don't really say what they're really thinking. But when you capture the right moment, it says more. You’re going to be home by 8, listening to the Talking Heads and reading Vonnegut or something. That sounds like a nice night.

                            Mouth-breather. Don’t take it so personally, okay? I don’t like most people. He’s in the vast majority. So, Jonathan, how was the pull-out? Mistakes have been made.

                            Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things. Yeah, I want a date with Bo Derek. We all want things. You are such a nerd. No wonder you only hang out with boys. Why are you keeping this curiosity door lock? Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.
