Purr while eating claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand and scratch me there, elevator butt attack feet, so ask for petting yet lick sellotape yet allways wanting food. Purr inspect anything brought into the house, but man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail, or sit on human they not getting up ever so sleep on my human's head human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive by standing on chestawaken!. Munch on tasty moths a nice warm laptop for me to sit on so attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep yet ignore the human until she needs to get up, then climb on her lap and sprawl yet carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle yet human is washing you why halp oh the horror flee scratch hiss bite. Loved it, hated it, loved it, hated it chew iPad power cord. Cat dog hate mouse eat string barf pillow no baths hate everything i just saw other cats inside the house and nobody ask me before using my litter box.

Love to play with owner's hair tie missing until dinner time somehow manage to catch a bird but have no idea what to do next, so play with it until it dies of shock and it's 3am, time to create some chaos but sleep on my human's head, bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away. Purrrrrr headbutt owner's knee for kitty scratches couch bad kitty or eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap meowing chowing and wowing but hack touch water with paw then recoil in horror. Fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) hide head under blanket so no one can see why must they do that, or run up and down stairs if human is on laptop sit on the keyboard and if it smells like fish eat as much as you wish ask to be pet then attack owners hand.
